Type Script
============
    Superset of JavaScript
        Code in TypeScript -> compile to JS

Nature of JavaScript
====================
Procedural
Object Oriented
Object Based
Functional (JS)
    Functions are first class citizens
        Functions are objects
            - created like objects
            - have attributes like objects
            - have methods like objects
            - passed as argument to other Function
            - returned as a return value from another function



Static
Dynamic (JS)
    - Attributes can be added to objects at runtime
    - Attributes can be remove from objects at runtime
    - Methods can be added to objects at runtime
    - Methods can be remove from objects at runtime



Strongly Typed
Loosely Typed (JS)

Uncertainity

TypeScript (typesafe javascript)
    Aid development
    TypeScript Compiler
    -> javascript



node --version

Mac
